# News API Feed

Application to get news from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) service.

## Setup

*To use this app you will need to signup with [News API](https://newsapi.org/) for a free API key.*

You will need to create a file ```secrets.py``` with variable ```NEWS_API_KEY``` set to your API key. See the ```secrets_sample.py``` file.

Make sure you have ```secrets.py`` in your ```.gitignore``` file so you don't accidentally publish your API Key.
